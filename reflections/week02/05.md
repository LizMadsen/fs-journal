# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  Eventually, I feel like I finally learned at least the basics of grasping javascript, which feels like a pretty big win right now! 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  

- What are you struggling with?

  Still just learning when to use what function, and how best to organize code, especially when the code starts getting longer.

- What would you count as a victory?

  The first answer to this applies here, too!
