## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

  Making a plan helps to lay out the basic functionality needed from the game, as well as potential hiccups and problems that may arise. While it won't show everything needed, it lays a good foundation to getting started.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

  Going back through the class notes is my first stop to finding help when I get stuck. After that, I go to websites such as mdn and stackoverflow, and then move to googling what I'm looking for.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

  Failing is not wrong or bad; in fact, failing is the point, and you should do it often so you learn how not to do that any longer (or at least as often).
