## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

  Scope is where the variables are available for use. If it's global, it's outside of any function, and if it's within a function, that's where it will be drawn from first.

2. What is Hoisting ?

  Hoisting is a way to move something to the top of its scope by using things such as var, let, and const before other functions such as console logging.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

  var isn't as commonly used, but can be in cses where two arrays need to reference each other (Batman and Superman are buddies); let is more commonly used to represent a variable induction; const is used when that variable needs to not be changed at all within the document.

  Sometimes, the answer is simpler than expected. There were times when I was trying far more complex solutions when, in reality, they weren't as complicated as I was making them.
