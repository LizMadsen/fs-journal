## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

  Font weight and color being changed to affect how a design is perceived is one of my favorite aspects of design, and can be used to help me not get too carried away with changing font sizes in my projects.
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

  Unsplash, https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/ helps with keeping colors consistent and complementary, font and icon libraries such as font awesome.
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

  A good website design can encourage someone to stay on the site to explore more. Being visually appealing and having clean design elements helps keep people's attention and keeps them wanting to look around.
