## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
  A pseudo-class is a selector that adds specificity to another selector. Ex: example vs .example
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
  Specificity is the process of narrowing down what you're targeting from something broad to something more focused. It's useful when targeting a class or ID that's repeated but could, on a broader level without a class or ID, apply to many other tags. (div vs div class="eg")
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
  With too many of anything being designated with the !important feature, a document begins to lose meaningful hierarchy, which causes problems not only for design purposes, but also for anyone who may need to edit the code and has to hunt down where the !important (that they're specifically looking for) is located.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  I had to really understand the difference between px and em/rem. I'm more comfortable using px, but learning that it isn't as responsive as the other two means I needed to drill em/rem into my head. As a fun fact, when looking at the conversion rate, 28px is 1.75rem, but I mistook that as 1px=1.75rem, and I set my header to 40rem. I very quickly realized my mistake.
