## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

  Wireframing helps with keeping containers, rows, and columns organized, which assists with making sure codes aren't getting overly complicated or has sister elements that shouldn't be next to each other.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

  Container: Shows everything that falls within the container, which is useful if there's any spill on the sides that needs to be address.
  Row: Breaks up websites into sub-categories, which helps keep things grouped and organized.
  Column: A sub-category of the row, which further breaks up elements and allows for flexibility in formatting on a smaller scale.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

  I do think they are worth it because even the simplest website can be broken up in ways that aren't intuitive to design without visualizing the breakdown. They become, I imagine, especially more useful in websites that are more complex or have multiple elements within each group.

Wireframing definitely helps in the layout. While we got the basic layout of the rows and columns figured out, it was the internal elements that began to elude us.
