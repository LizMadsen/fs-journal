## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

  Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time, which allows for fewer discrepencies and conflicts to occur. THis is done by having local and remote repositories, as well as the ability to work on multiple branches before merging into the final code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

  Multiple branches allows for simultaneous developments to be done prior to merging them into the final code.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

  Git is a command line interface where files can be created and modified in local repositories, whereas GitHub is where code can be uploaded to be shared with other people.

  >I accidentally started working in powershell rather than in Git, and I don't know if there's a difference between them because they seemed to function similarly, but I redid everything in Git regardless. There was one command using -m that didn't seem to work properly for me, but I understood the reading and the points that were relayed about Git, and followed along with the reading in Git even with the error I received, as well as understanding the reason behind the commands used.
