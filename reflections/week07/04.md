![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Pair programming, clean and smooth UI

2. What went well this week?

We finished the project and in the end it turned out well

3. What would you do differently?

I would listen to Mark and not do the front end and the back end separately. That caused a lot of problems down the road that led to strife amongst the team. It got sorted out, but I would definitely approach the project differently.
