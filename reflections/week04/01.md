> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

  Having a 'pyramid' of "})" at the end of the code is one of the telltale signs of  callback hell. It's caused by code being embedded within code repeatedly (ad nauseum).

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

  Asynchronous means that the code is being called from another source or API. Callbacks are involved because the code doesn't pull results immediately since it's waiting on another source.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

  Keeping code shallow, modularizing, and handling errors to keep the code stable.

  Calling to other API's is a simple idea, but the code needs to be handled carefully to ensure everything goes correctly.
