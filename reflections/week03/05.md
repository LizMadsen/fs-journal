# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  Honestly, not a lot. I mean, eventually everything started working, but it was a real struggle.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  How difficult some of the logic can be to make work.

- What are you struggling with?

  Kind of a lot of it. The things that broke were really strange, and the fixes sometimes felt like they weren't intuitive or made sense.

- What would you count as a victory?

  Eventually, most things started working.
