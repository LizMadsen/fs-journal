## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

  Encapsulation allows us to control the data through import and export.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

  They're new and controversial, and sometimes aren't defined within someone's knowledge base, so they believe they can do what those functions do, but better.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

  You create a private variable by declaring a variable but not exporting it. This keeps it from being exported, but still allows it to be accessed during runtime.
